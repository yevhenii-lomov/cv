<summary> Summary </summary>

---

With over 14 years of experience in software development, I have honed my skills in leading, development, and architecture. My journey has seen me contribute to various projects, from smaller, focused endeavors to large-scale projects involving over 100 team members.

Throughout my career, I have worn many hats, serving as a developer, DevOps specialist, leader, and architect. In the past five years, my focus has been on leading and performing architecture activities. This includes engaging in presales, conducting discoveries, performing assessments, and providing project architecture support.

One of my key responsibilities has been leading different project streams to ensure the alignment of architecture with implementation. I have also played a vital role in architecture governance, ensuring that projects adhere to architectural guidelines and best practices.

I have a hands-on approach and actively participate in development, management, and DevOps activities. Additionally, I also have hands-on experience in developing proof of concepts (POCs) to validate architectural decisions and foster innovation.

I am committed to continuous improvement and innovation, always seeking new challenges and opportunities to expand my skills and deliver projects goals
